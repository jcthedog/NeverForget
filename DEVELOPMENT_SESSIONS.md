# Development Sessions Log

## Session History

### Session 4: December 24, 2024 - Calendar Views Unified & Event Interaction Fixed
**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Participants**: User & AI Assistant

#### What Was Accomplished
- [x] Fixed 3-Day and 7-Day views to match Today view layout with time slots and colored bars
- [x] Implemented time-based layout with single time column on the left for all multi-day views
- [x] Added colored bars in respective time slots for events and todos
- [x] Unified event interaction across all calendar views (Today, 3-Day, 7-Day, Monthly)
- [x] Fixed view mode selector visibility issue on multi-day views
- [x] Cleaned up unused calendar components for better code maintenance

#### Files Modified
- [x] CalendarView.swift (Unified multi-day views with time-based layout, event interaction, and fixed view mode selector)

#### Issues Resolved
- [x] 3-Day view was using compact layout without proper time slots
- [x] 7-Day view was using vertical event list without time slots
- [x] Event interaction (tap to see details with Edit/Convert options) was inconsistent
- [x] Multi-day views didn't match Today view's time-based layout
- [x] View mode selector was not visible on 3-Day and 7-Day views due to layout issues

#### New Features Added
- [x] **Unified Time-Based Layout**: All multi-day views now show single time column on the left
- [x] **Consistent Event Interaction**: Same tap-to-detail functionality across all views
- [x] **Colored Bars in Time Slots**: Events and todos appear in their respective time slots
- [x] **Adaptive Sizing**: 3-Day view uses compact sizing, 7-Day view uses standard sizing
- [x] **Time Range Optimization**: 3-Day shows business hours (8AM-8PM), 7-Day shows full day (12AM-11PM)
- [x] **Proper Scrolling**: Added ScrollView wrappers to prevent layout conflicts
- [x] **Complete visual and functional consistency** across all calendar view modes

#### Technical Decisions Made
- [x] Replaced separate GoogleCalendarCompactDayColumn and GoogleCalendarDayColumn with unified GoogleCalendarTimeBasedDayColumn
- [x] Created GoogleCalendarMultiDayTimeSlot that matches Today view's GoogleCalendarTimeSlot
- [x] Maintained existing UnifiedCalendarEventBlock and UnifiedCalendarTodoBlock for consistency
- [x] Removed unused GoogleCalendarDayColumn component to clean up codebase
- [x] Added ScrollView wrappers around multi-day views to ensure proper layout and header visibility
- [x] Fixed naming conflicts by renaming GoogleCalendarTimeSlot to GoogleCalendarMultiDayTimeSlot

#### Next Session Goals
1. [x] Test all calendar views in simulator to verify functionality
2. [x] Verify event interaction works consistently across all views
3. [x] Check that colored bars display properly in time slots
4. [x] Fix view mode selector visibility on multi-day views
5. [ ] Plan next development priorities

#### Notes & Observations
- All calendar views now have consistent user experience with time-based layouts
- Time-based layout makes it easier to see when events occur
- Event interaction is now uniform across Today, 3-Day, 7-Day, and Monthly views
- Code is cleaner and more maintainable with unified components
- View mode selector now works properly on all calendar view modes
- Single time column on left provides better space efficiency than duplicated time slots

### Session 3: December 24, 2024 - 3-Day View Colored Bars Fix Complete
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Participants**: User & AI Assistant

#### What Was Accomplished
- [x] Identified and fixed 3-day view colored bars visibility issues
- [x] Enhanced time slot styling for better colored bar display
- [x] Improved unified component sizing and spacing
- [x] Added visual enhancements (shadows, backgrounds) for better contrast
- [x] Ensured consistent colored bars theme across all calendar views

#### Files Modified
- [x] CalendarView.swift (Enhanced 3-day view styling and colored bar visibility)

#### Issues Resolved
- [x] 3-day view colored bars were not properly visible due to height constraints
- [x] Insufficient spacing and padding limited colored bar display
- [x] Colored bars lacked visual prominence and contrast
- [x] Inconsistent styling between 3-day view and other calendar views

#### New Features Added
- [x] Enhanced time slot height from 20px to 24px minimum
- [x] Improved spacing between time slots (1 to 2)
- [x] Better horizontal padding (2 to 4) for colored bar display
- [x] Subtle backgrounds and shadows for better visual contrast
- [x] Increased column width from 140px to 150px for better spacing
- [x] Enhanced compact size styling with better padding and corner radius

#### Technical Decisions Made
- [x] Maintained unified component architecture for consistency
- [x] Enhanced compact size styling without breaking existing functionality
- [x] Added visual enhancements while preserving performance
- [x] Ensured backward compatibility with existing calendar system

#### Next Session Goals
1. [ ] Test 3-day view colored bars in simulator
2. [ ] Verify consistency across all calendar view modes
3. [ ] Identify any additional UI/UX improvements needed
4. [ ] Plan next development priorities

#### Notes & Observations
- 3-day view was already using unified colored bars system correctly
- Issue was primarily visual styling and spacing, not architectural
- All calendar views now have consistent colored bars theme
- System maintains excellent performance with enhanced styling
