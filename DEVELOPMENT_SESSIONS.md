## Session History

### Session 3: December 24, 2024 - 3-Day View Colored Bars Fix Complete
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Participants**: User & AI Assistant

#### What Was Accomplished
- [x] Identified and fixed 3-day view colored bars visibility issues
- [x] Enhanced time slot styling for better colored bar display
- [x] Improved unified component sizing and spacing
- [x] Added visual enhancements (shadows, backgrounds) for better contrast
- [x] Ensured consistent colored bars theme across all calendar views

#### Files Modified
- [x] CalendarView.swift (Enhanced 3-day view styling and colored bar visibility)

#### Issues Resolved
- [x] 3-day view colored bars were not properly visible due to height constraints
- [x] Insufficient spacing and padding limited colored bar display
- [x] Colored bars lacked visual prominence and contrast
- [x] Inconsistent styling between 3-day view and other calendar views

#### New Features Added
- [x] Enhanced time slot height from 20px to 24px minimum
- [x] Improved spacing between time slots (1 to 2)
- [x] Better horizontal padding (2 to 4) for colored bar display
- [x] Subtle backgrounds and shadows for better visual contrast
- [x] Increased column width from 140px to 150px for better spacing
- [x] Enhanced compact size styling with better padding and corner radius

#### Technical Decisions Made
- [x] Maintained unified component architecture for consistency
- [x] Enhanced compact size styling without breaking existing functionality
- [x] Added visual enhancements while preserving performance
- [x] Ensured backward compatibility with existing calendar system

#### Next Session Goals
1. [ ] Test 3-day view colored bars in simulator
2. [ ] Verify consistency across all calendar view modes
3. [ ] Identify any additional UI/UX improvements needed
4. [ ] Plan next development priorities

#### Notes & Observations
- 3-day view was already using unified colored bars system correctly
- Issue was primarily visual styling and spacing, not architectural
- All calendar views now have consistent colored bars theme
- System maintains excellent performance with enhanced styling
