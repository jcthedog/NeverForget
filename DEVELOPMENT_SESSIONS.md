## Session 5: Calendar Integration Attempt and Project Setup Discovery
**Date**: September 1, 2025  
**Duration**: 2 hours  
**Status**: Completed with important discovery

### **Objective**
Attempt to integrate the three existing view files (`CreateEventView`, `CreateTodoView`, `EventDetailView`) into the calendar system to replace placeholder views.

### **What Was Attempted**
1. **Calendar Integration**: Attempted to replace placeholder views in `CalendarView.swift` with actual view references
2. **View Integration**: Tried to integrate `CreateEventView`, `CreateTodoView`, and `EventDetailView` into the calendar system
3. **Build Testing**: Tested project compilation to verify integration success

### **What Was Discovered**
1. **Views Not in Project**: The three view files exist as Swift files but are not included in the Xcode project build target
2. **Compilation Failure**: Project failed to compile because views couldn't be found in scope
3. **Project Structure Issue**: The views exist in the file system but are not part of the Xcode project structure

### **What Was Accomplished**
1. **Toolbar Fix**: Resolved toolbar ambiguity issue in `CalendarView.swift`
2. **Placeholder Restoration**: Successfully restored placeholder views to maintain functionality
3. **Build Success**: Project now builds successfully with placeholder views
4. **Documentation Update**: Updated project documentation to reflect current status

### **Technical Details**
- **Issue**: Views exist as `.swift` files but are not in `Never Forget.xcodeproj` project file
- **Impact**: Calendar system cannot access these views for full integration
- **Solution**: Views need to be added to Xcode project target before integration can proceed
- **Current State**: Calendar system functional with placeholder views, ready for full integration

### **Files Modified**
- `CalendarView.swift` - Fixed toolbar ambiguity and restored placeholder views
- `PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Updated to reflect current integration status

### **Next Steps Required**
1. **Project Setup**: Add three view files to Xcode project target
2. **Integration**: Replace placeholder views with actual view references
3. **Testing**: Verify full calendar functionality works correctly
4. **Production Ready**: App will be ready for App Store submission

### **Key Learning**
The most critical step in iOS development is ensuring all source files are properly included in the Xcode project. Files can exist in the file system but won't be compiled or accessible unless they're part of the project target.
