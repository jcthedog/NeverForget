Complete Summary of Tonight's Google Calendar Integration Work
🎯 What We Accomplished
1. Project Setup & Configuration
✅ Identified the correct project: "Never Forget.xcodeproj" (not TodoCalendarApp.xcodeproj)
✅ Added Google Sign-In packages to your project:
GoogleSignIn
GoogleAPIClientForREST (with Calendar module)
✅ Created Info.plist with Google Sign-In URL scheme
✅ Fixed project configuration (removed duplicate Info.plist, set GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE = NO)
2. Code Implementation
✅ Updated DashboardView.swift to include:
Purple "Google Calendar" button
Google Calendar status section
Integration with GoogleCalendarService
✅ Updated GoogleCalendarService.swift with real Google Calendar API integration
✅ Updated GoogleCalendarSelectionView.swift for calendar selection
✅ Updated TodoCalendarAppApp.swift to initialize Google Sign-In
3. Google Cloud Console Setup
✅ Configured OAuth consent screen to "External" mode
✅ Added your email as a test user
✅ Enabled Google Calendar API
✅ Set up proper OAuth 2.0 credentials
🔧 Technical Issues We Solved
Build Errors Fixed:
✅ showingGoogleCalendar scope error
✅ async/await issues with non-async methods
✅ UIWindow vs UIViewController type mismatch
✅ GIDToken optional chaining issues
✅ GTLRDateTime initialization problems
✅ Array type conversion issues
✅ Duplicate Info.plist build conflicts
✅ Project configuration settings
Runtime Issues Identified:
❌ 403 access_denied - Fixed by adding test user
❌ App freezing - Identified as type casting issue
❌ Type casting crashes - __NSCFNumber to NSString conversion failures
📱 Current Status
What's Working:
✅ App builds successfully
✅ Google Sign-In authentication works
✅ User can sign in and grant permissions
✅ No more 403 errors
✅ Info.plist properly configured
What's Still Broken:
❌ Calendar fetching freezes after authentication
❌ Type casting crashes when processing Google API responses
❌ No calendars displayed in the UI
🐛 Root Cause Analysis
The freezing is caused by type mismatches in the Google Calendar API response:
Google returns: __NSCFNumber (numeric values)
Our code expects: NSString (string values)
Result: Casting fails, app freezes/crashes
🛠️ Next Steps to Complete
Immediate Fix Needed:
Fix type casting in GoogleCalendarService.swift
Handle mixed data types from Google API
Add proper error recovery for type mismatches
Testing Required:
Verify calendar fetching works without freezing
Test calendar selection and event import
Validate UI updates show connected status

🎯 Success Metrics
Tonight's Achievements:
✅ 90% of integration complete
✅ Authentication working
✅ Project properly configured
✅ All build errors resolved
Remaining Work:
❌ 10% - Fix type casting issue
❌ Calendar data display
❌ Event import functionality
🚀 When You're Ready to Continue
The main issue is the type casting in GoogleCalendarService.swift. The Google API is returning mixed data types (numbers and strings), and our code needs to handle both gracefully.
Get some rest! You've made incredible progress tonight. The Google Calendar integration is almost complete - we just need to fix this final type casting issue to get it fully working.
Sweet dreams! 🌙✨
