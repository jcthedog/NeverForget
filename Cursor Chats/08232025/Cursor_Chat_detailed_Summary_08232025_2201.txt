The attached tet file is a summary of our last chat. After you read it and get caught up. I would like to make a few changes. First of all, I need a new calendar style. I want a calendar that displays all events in a date's view, allowing you to click on a specific event to bring up it's details. After clicking on an event is where I would like to have the option to convert a Google Calendar Event into a Never Forget Todo. Can we do this?@Cursor_Chat_detailed_Summary_08232025_2140.txt 

I've read through the summary and understand the current state of your Never Forget app. You have a fully functional Google Calendar integration with event import capabilities, and now you want to enhance it with a new calendar style that shows all events in a date view with the ability to click on events and convert them to todos.
Let me first examine the current codebase to understand the existing calendar implementation and then create the new calendar view you're requesting.
Now let me examine the existing Google Calendar integration to understand how events are currently handled:
Now let me check the DashboardViewModel to understand how events are currently managed:
Let me continue reading the DashboardViewModel to see if there are any Google Calendar event methods:
Now let me check the GoogleCalendarService to understand how events are fetched:
Let me continue reading the GoogleCalendarService to see the event fetching methods:
Let me continue reading to see the complete event fetching implementation:
Now let me check the SharedTypes to understand the Todo structure:
Let me check the Todo.swift file to understand the Todo structure:
Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of your app's current state. Based on the summary and code review, I can see that you have:
âœ… A fully functional Google Calendar integration
âœ… Event fetching capabilities
âœ… Todo management system
âœ… A basic calendar view that shows todos
Now I'll create the new calendar style you requested - one that displays all events in a date's view, allows clicking on events to see details, and provides the option to convert Google Calendar events to Never Forget todos.
Let me create a new enhanced calendar view:
Now I need to add back the missing CalendarTodoRow and EmptyDateView that were accidentally removed:
Now I need to update the DashboardViewModel to include methods for managing Google Calendar events. Let me add the necessary functionality:
Now let me update the GoogleCalendarService to ensure it properly handles the selected calendars for event fetching. I need to check if there's a method to get the selected calendars:
Now let me update the CalendarView to properly handle the case when no calendars are selected and to show a message when Google Calendar is not connected:
Now let me also update the loadEventsForDate method to handle the case when no calendars are selected:
Now let me build the project to make sure everything compiles correctly:
Let me try building with an available simulator:
Excellent! The build succeeded. Now let me create a summary of what I've implemented for you:
