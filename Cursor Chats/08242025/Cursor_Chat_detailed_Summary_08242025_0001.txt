I can see from the summary that we've been working on the calendar views and need to make them visually consistent with colored bars. Let me examine the current CalendarView.swift to see how the different views are currently implemented and then standardize them to all use colored bars.
Now I can see the current implementation. Looking at the code, I can see that some views are using colored bars (like GoogleCalendarEventBlock and GoogleCalendarTodoBlock) while others are showing just times. Let me standardize all the views to use colored bars consistently.
The main areas that need to be updated are:
Today View - Already uses colored bars ‚úÖ
3-Day View - Uses colored bars ‚úÖ
7-Day View - Uses colored bars ‚úÖ
Monthly View - Uses colored bars ‚úÖ
Actually, looking more closely, I can see that all the views are already using colored bars! The GoogleCalendarEventBlock and GoogleCalendarTodoBlock components are used throughout and they display colored bars.
However, I notice that in the monthly view, the EventRow and TodoRow components in the day cells are using a different style (small circles with text). Let me check if you want me to make those consistent with the colored bars as well.
Let me also verify that all the time-based views are showing colored bars consistently. Looking at the code, I can see that:
Today View: Uses GoogleCalendarTimeSlot ‚Üí GoogleCalendarEventBlock (colored bars) ‚úÖ
3-Day View: Uses GoogleCalendarCompactTimeSlot ‚Üí GoogleCalendarCompactEventBlock (colored bars) ‚úÖ
7-Day View: Uses GoogleCalendarDayColumn ‚Üí GoogleCalendarEventBlock (colored bars) ‚úÖ
Monthly View: Uses EventRow and TodoRow (small circles with text) ‚ùå
I think the issue might be that you want the monthly view day cells to also use colored bars instead of the current small circle style. Let me update the monthly view to use colored bars consistently with the other views:
Perfect! Now let me also check if there are any other inconsistencies. Let me look at the compact event and todo blocks to make sure they're also using the same colored bar style:
Let me find the compact event and todo blocks:
Great! I can see that the compact event and todo blocks are already using colored bars consistently. Now let me check the main event and todo blocks to make sure they're also consistent:
Perfect! Now I can see the complete picture. All the main calendar views are already using colored bars consistently:
Today View: ‚úÖ Uses GoogleCalendarEventBlock (colored bars)
3-Day View: ‚úÖ Uses GoogleCalendarCompactEventBlock (colored bars)
7-Day View: ‚úÖ Uses GoogleCalendarEventBlock (colored bars)
Monthly View: ‚úÖ Now uses updated EventRow and TodoRow (colored bars)
The only place that still uses the old circle style is in the DateEventsPopup (the popup that appears when you tap a date in the monthly view). Let me update that to also use colored bars for consistency:
Now let me also update the todos section in the popup to use colored bars:
Now let me update the todos section in the popup to use colored bars:
Perfect! Now let me test if the project builds successfully with all the visual consistency updates:
Let me try building with an available simulator:
üéâ Excellent! Your project builds successfully with all the visual consistency updates!
